    <h1>Hearty Vegetable Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="images/hearty-vegetable-lasagna.jpg" alt="hearty-vegetable-lasagna">
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>0 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>4 cups cauliflower Alfredo sauce</li>
        <li>5 cups veggies (I used chopped fresh greens, grated carrots, fresh and canned tomatoes)</li>
        <li>3 cups mixed shredded cheese like Mozzarella, Provolone, Parmesan, etc.</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>For the cauliflower sauce: Saute the garlic with the butter in a large nonstick skillet 
            over low heat until the garlic is soft and fragrant. Bring the cauliflower in the water 
            or broth for 7-10 minutes or until cauliflower is fork tender. Do not drain. Use a slotted
            spoon to transfer the cauliflower pieces to a blender or food processor. Add 1 cup vegetable
            broth or cooking liquid, sauteed garlic/butter, salt, pepper, and milk. Blend or puree for 
            several minutes or until very smooth.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Boil the lasagna noodles for a few minutes until they are just 
            starting to soften but still stiff and cool enough to handle.</li>
        <li>Spread a spoonful of cauliflower sauce on the bottom of a 9 inch square glass baking dish 
            with a drizzle of olive oil to prevent sticking. Layer lasagna noodles, 1/2 cup sauce, one
             fourth of the veggies, a good sprinkle of salt, 1/2 cup cheese, and 1/4 cup sauce (I put 
             sauce in each layer twice, once under the veggies and once on top). Repeat layers 4 times,
              ending with noodles. Cover the top noodle layer with 1/2 cup sauce and the remaining 1 cup 
              of cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover with greased foil and bake for 25 minutes. The liquid should be bubbling along the sides
             of the dish. Remove the foil and bake uncovered for another 10-20 minutes or until the cheese
              is golden brown to your liking. Cool for a few minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
    </ol>
