    <h1>Double Chocolate Cake</h1>
    <img src="images/double-chocolate-cake.jpeg" alt="Double Chocolate Cake">
    <p>This is the most fabulous chocolate cake that I've ever made," Ina Garten declared 
        when F&W ran her recipe in 2007. The buttermilk keeps the cake moist and light,
        and the bit of coffee in the cake and frosting keeps the sweetness in check.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups sugar</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups flour</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vanilla extract</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease three round baking pans and set aside. In
             a large bowl, stir together sugar, flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, 
             and salt. Add eggs, buttermilk, melted butter and vanilla extract; beat 2 minutes 
             on medium speed. Stir in hot coffee.</li>
        <li>Pour batter evenly between the three pans and bake on middle rack of oven for 30 
            to 35 minutes, until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool completely
             on wire racks before frosting.</li>
